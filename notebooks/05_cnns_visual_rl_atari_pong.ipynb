    "**1. Spatial Hierarchies**\n",
    "- Early layers detect simple features (edges, colors)\n",
    "- Middle layers detect patterns (shapes, textures)\n",
    "- Later layers detect objects (paddle, ball, score)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Weight Sharing**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **B** - CNNs exploit spatial structure through weight sharing (same filter across image) and local connectivity (each neuron connects to a small region), making them much more parameter-efficient for images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **C** - Frame stacking provides temporal information. By seeing object positions across multiple frames, the network can infer velocity (position change) and acceleration (velocity change).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **B** - Resizing to 84x84 significantly reduces computational cost (fewer pixels to process) while still preserving the important features needed for gameplay decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **C** - Unlike pooling which loses spatial information through max/average operations, stride preserves the learned features' spatial relationships, which is important for making spatially-aware decisions in RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **B** - Different Atari games have vastly different score scales (Pong: +/-21, Space Invaders: hundreds). Clipping normalizes rewards so the same hyperparameters can work across games.\n",

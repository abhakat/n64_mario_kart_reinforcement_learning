    "Answer these questions to check your understanding of CNNs for visual RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Why are CNNs preferred over fully connected networks for visual input?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) CNNs are always faster to train  \n",
    "B) CNNs exploit spatial structure through weight sharing and local connectivity  \n",
    "C) CNNs don't require preprocessing  \n",
    "D) CNNs can only be used with images\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: What information does frame stacking provide that a single frame cannot?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Higher resolution images  \n",
    "B) Color information  \n",
    "C) Temporal information like velocity and acceleration  \n",
    "D) Sound data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3**: Why do we resize Atari frames to 84x84?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) It's the native resolution of Atari games  \n",
    "B) To reduce computational cost while preserving important features  \n",
    "C) The NatureCNN only works with 84x84 images  \n",
    "D) To increase the amount of training data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4**: In the NatureCNN architecture, what is the purpose of using stride instead of pooling?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Stride is computationally cheaper  \n",
    "B) Pooling doesn't work with CNNs  \n",
    "C) Stride preserves more spatial information needed for RL decisions  \n",
    "D) There is no difference between stride and pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5**: Why do Atari preprocessing pipelines clip rewards to {-1, 0, 1}?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Atari games only have these three reward values  \n",
    "B) To normalize rewards across different games with varying score scales  \n",
    "C) To make the game easier  \n",
    "D) To reduce memory usage\n",

    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answers</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **B** - CNNs exploit spatial structure through weight sharing (same filter across image) and local connectivity (each neuron connects to a small region), making them much more parameter-efficient for images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **C** - Frame stacking provides temporal information. By seeing object positions across multiple frames, the network can infer velocity (position change) and acceleration (velocity change).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **B** - Resizing to 84x84 significantly reduces computational cost (fewer pixels to process) while still preserving the important features needed for gameplay decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **C** - Unlike pooling which loses spatial information through max/average operations, stride preserves the learned features' spatial relationships, which is important for making spatially-aware decisions in RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **B** - Different Atari games have vastly different score scales (Pong: +/-21, Space Invaders: hundreds). Clipping normalizes rewards so the same hyperparameters can work across games.\n",

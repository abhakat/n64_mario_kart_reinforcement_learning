    "**Disadvantages of pixels:**\n",
    "- High dimensional input (320 x 240 x 3 = 230,400 values)\n",

    "\n",
    "### How to Find RAM Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to find new addresses or verify existing ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: Use a Memory Scanner\n",
    "1. Run the game in an emulator with memory viewing capability\n",
    "2. Look for values that change predictably (e.g., speed when accelerating)\n",
    "3. Use \"scan for changed/unchanged values\" to narrow down\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: Check Existing Documentation\n",
    "- GameHacking.org database\n",
    "- Speedrunning community wikis\n",
    "- Tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) resources\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 3: Disassemble the ROM\n",
    "- Use tools like Ghidra or IDA Pro\n",
    "- Look for game state structures\n",
    "- Trace code that updates player state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test known values**: If you know your speed is 0 when stopped, verify the address reads 0\n",
    "2. **Test boundary conditions**: Max speed, lap transitions, etc.\n",
    "3. **Cross-reference**: Compare with multiple sources\n",
    "4. **Version check**: Verify ROM version matches address documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrong ROM version**: US, PAL, and Japanese versions have different addresses\n",
    "- **Endianness errors**: N64 is big-endian, x86 is little-endian\n",
    "- **Address space confusion**: Virtual vs physical addresses\n",
    "- **Data type mismatch**: Reading a float as int or vice versa"

    "In this notebook, we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAM Reading Advantages**: Lower dimensional input, exact values, no CNN needed\n",
    "2. **N64 Memory Layout**: KSEG0 virtual memory, 4MB RDRAM\n",
    "3. **Mario Kart 64 Addresses**: Speed, position, lap, checkpoint, and more\n",
    "4. **Big-Endian Byte Order**: N64 stores bytes MSB-first\n",
    "5. **struct Module**: Reading binary data with >f, >B, >H, >I formats\n",
    "6. **MarioKartRAMReader**: Complete class for reading all game state\n",
    "7. **MockMemory**: Testing without emulator\n",
    "8. **Visualization**: Analyzing race trajectories from RAM data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- RAM reading provides **precise, low-dimensional state** for RL\n",
    "- Always use **big-endian** format when reading N64 memory\n",
    "- **Verify addresses** against your specific ROM version\n",
    "- The `get_observation_vector()` method provides ready-to-use RL input\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect the RAM reader to the actual emulator\n",
    "2. Design reward functions using RAM state\n",
    "3. Build the complete RL environment\n",
